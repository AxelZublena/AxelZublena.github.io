                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p style="text-indent:40px">My name is Axel Zublena, I’m 18 years old and I have a twin brother. I’m French with a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morne-A-l'Eau,+Guadeloupe/@16.3218094,-61.6388904,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8c1336312c293daf:0xcc3a81d6ce8214d6!8m2!3d16.3282965!4d-61.4785718" target="_blank">Guadeloupean root</a>. I followed the standard French education path and specialized in science. I got the opportunity to choose between biology and engineering, and I went for engineering because biology is only French literature about rocks and frogs. During <a href="https://www.collegechevreul.fr/etablissement/presentation-2/" target="_blank">middle school</a> I discovered computer science and explored every field of it. After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Martini%C3%A8re_Lyon" target="_blank">high school</a>, because I wasn’t in love with math and I didn't wanted to calculate the forces applied on a bridge all my life, so I went in the Netherlands to study software engineering at <a href="https://hz.nl/en/" target="_blank">HZ University of Applied Science</a>.</p>

                <h1>Automobile Racing</h1>
                <p style="text-indent:40px">I knew for a long time that I like cars, but because my family isn’t really in the motorsport world and because I like computer, I never followed this path. So aside from computer science, I love every kind of motorsports (<a href="https://www.formula1.com/" target="_blank">F1</a>, <a href="https://www.gt-world-challenge-europe.com/" target="_blank">GT</a>, <a href="https://www.nascar.com/" target="_blank">NASCAR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCZJinpbGvU" target="_blank">drag racing</a>, <a href="https://www.driftmasters.gp/" target="_blank">drift</a>...). Furthermore, there is now ultra-realistic racing video games which can be played with a steering wheel and a set of pedals. So, these last 2 years, I played at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFactor_2" target="_blank">rFactor 2</a> which is a game used by professionals to train themselves. Like some before me, I was hoping to go from playing on my computer to driving in real life. One of my biggest achievement is participating in an official <a href="https://youtu.be/P7g-NMgGqzo?t=1567" target="_blank">race</a> organized by BMW Motorsport. But for now, I have set this passion in standby to focus on my studies at HZ.</p>
