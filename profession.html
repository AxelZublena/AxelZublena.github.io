                <p><span style="font-size: 30px;font-weight: 700;">Macaw</span> is a Dutch company that create solutions for enterprise. For me, Macaw is one of these companies where you don't really know what they do. It often looks like a lot of talking and not a lot of ground breaking technologies. But after I learned more about the company, I realized that Macaw (like others) is just focused on companies and not on you and me.</br>While Macaw is a Dutch company, it has an international philosophy. So while it's not the greatest company from my point of view, it's the one I prefer.</p>

                <p><span style="font-size: 30px;font-weight: 700;">Veracode</span> is a company focused on software security. Veracode is based in Burlington, Massachusetts in the USA and is not a small company with almost 750 employees. Technologies used by Veracode are the .NET framework and almost everything related to software developement. The biggest particularity of Veracode is the fact that almost every employee work remotely. While I really like cybersecurity, because working at Veracode mean working "alone" in my house, the company is not one where I would like to work at.</p>

Your Suprise needs a website to sell products the company manufacture itself. Your Surprise uses machine learning to predict its growth, a language they created (YIMP: Your Image Personalization) and web technologies. Like Macaw, Your Surprise attaches importance to the quality of life of its employees. This company looks fun to work for, but as an international student who wants to travel, Your Surprise is not for me.</p>
