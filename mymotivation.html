            </div>
            <div class="motivation-info">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>According to the <a href="#1">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, motivation is a noun used to designate the enthusiasm for doing something.</p>
                <p>There are two types of motivation according to Ryan, R. M. and Deci, E. L. <a href="#2">(Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation from a self-determination theory perspective: Definitions, theory, practices, and future directions, (2020))</a>: intrinsic and extrinsic.</p>
                <p>Intrinsic motivation corresponds to activities done because they provide joy and only because it fulfills us. E.g. Being motivated to eat candy because it will give us dopamine. </br>Often in contrast with intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation corresponds to behaviors done for an external reason. E.g. Being motivated to earn money with the end goal of buying the latest laptop to be the cool kid.</p>
                <p>Related to university, the article <a href="#3">Trajectories of motivation and their academic correlates over the first year of college</a>, explain that during the first year of college, the intrinsic motivation (autonomous motivation) of students begin high but decreases during the year, while extrinsic motivation (controlled motivation) begins low and increase over the year.</p>
                <p>To conclude this definition, according to Usher, A. & Kober, N. <a href="#4">(What is motivation and why does it matter? (2020))</a>, we can note that motivation (intrinsic or extrinsic) is a really important factor in our day-to-day life, and even more so with education.</p>
                <h2>The puzzle of motivation</h2>
                <p>In the TED Talk presented by Pink, D. <a href="#5">(The puzzle of motivation. TEDGlobal 2009)</a>, we learn how what is done in the business world is against what science knows.</p>
                <p>For companies, the best way to increase the motivation of their employees is to increase rewards. This method of managing is great for boosting the extrinsic motivation of the company. The only problem is that numerous studies conclude that high rewards do not mean better work/minds, it’s often the opposite that happens.</p>
                <p>The conclusion made by Dan Pink, supported by many real-life examples and studies, states that businesses need to shift towards a new way of managing. This new way is based on autonomy, mastery and purpose.</p>

                <h1>Performance Motivation</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="motivation-info">
                <p><i>"You sometimes have a <b>strong drive for completing important tasks</b>, but you will often not be driven if you do not feel the task is important enough, however you are <b>very motivated by seeking reward for your behaviour</b>. The offer of a reward (such as a promotion for working hard or winning a bet) will keep you motivated to complete difficult activities.</br><b>Your major motivation is to avoid things that you don't like</b>. This can mean <b>organising your life to avoid activities you don't enjoy, or to escape</b> punishment or pain. You can also tend to be a fairly nervous person."</i> from my personality report, <a href="#6">www.seemypersonality.com</a></p>
                <p>I mostly agree with this test. First because when a task involves a high reward or will likely create some opportunities for me, I will feel strongly motivated. Then I live my life knowing what I want, and therefore what I don’t want. The last part of the report sounds true to me because I like to organize my life, make a plan for my future, and design them to escape what I don’t like.</br></br>One feedback I received after doing my pitch on my website was “goal-oriented”. I like to organize my life, so I have goals sets and milestones to achieve. Because my goals are defined and might be redefined by my work and experiences, I am goal-oriented.</br></br>Another feedback from my application assignment was to not rely on my experience for the 4 years to come. While I sometimes try to avoid this truth because it is not important at the moment, I end up sticking to this rule because I know that I need to be good so I can avoid what I don’t like in the future.</p>
                <p>One thing I would like to add is that this personality report explain why I went studying in the Netherlands. I made this choice because the options offered to me in France were good, but they would not have brought me closer to my life goals.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="motivation-info">
                <p>Prestige is an important value for me. One example of that would be the company where I want to work after I finished school. While I could work in a start-up, I want to work at Microsoft, Google, or IBM because they are prestigious companies. This boost my extrinsic motivation to work at school to one day be able to work at one of these organizations.</br></br>Structure is also an important factor when it comes to work. Knowing what exactly needs to be done is great. I work faster, I can organize my life more easily and because I’m not an artist, not having room for creativity is not a problem. This is why I like programming: follow the rules or the computer will not understand you.</br></br>On the other hand, the work-life balance is really not important for me. I don’t work because I have to, but because I like what I do. In computer science is not a chore, it’s a great way of passing time. That’s why my intrinsic motivation is at high this year. Unlike high school where I was doing things I didn’t enjoy, learning only computer science at university is great.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="motivation-info">
                <p>After evaluating myself, I confirmed that I’m motivated for this study program. My intrinsic motivation is as high as ever and my extrinsic motivation is not bad either. I now have a better understanding of what motivation is and how it affects me.</p>
                <p>My mother and my brother are two different people whom I asked what they think of my conclusions. One thing they noticed is my lack of acknowledgment of "being nervous" described in my personality report, <a href="#6">www.seemypersonality.com</a>. This is due to the fact that I understand "being nervous" as wanting to punch a wall, where I think my nervosity is more comparable to anxiety or stress.</p>
