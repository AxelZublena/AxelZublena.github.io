            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>My first laptop was very old and it could only run with Lubuntu. I learned how a computer works, what can you do with it and how much troubleshooting is fun. I have since then learned a few languages and technologies. I like computer science, but after having tried almost every field of it, I know what I want to be good at. I like software development with language like C#, web is not my strong suite and networking is fun, but I find it complex to learn. That is why I have chosen the HBO-ICT program.</p>

            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>When I think about my future, at what I will be able to do after school, I am always worried about how I will fit in the professional world. The learning process of HZ answers this question. In fact, we already know and will learn to use tools used by the professionals like GitHub. Working on project allow me to use tools that I would not have used otherwise like the project tab in my GitHub repository. Also, I find the learn.hz.nl website very useful and well designed to learn.</p>

            <h1>Collaboration</h1>
            <p>In high school, my specialization was engineering. Each year, I had a big assignment on which I had to work in a group and apply the knowledge I learned during the year. I am therefore used to work in collaboration with other students on a project. I also like to apply the knowledge I learn in class, and unlike a theorical university, a university of applied science allows me to learn faster and better. And so far, the HZ University of Applied Science is perfect for me.</p>
